## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### 🚨 A Healthcare Crisis in Africa

#### **Quantifiable Data Points:**

**1. Prescription Fraud Epidemic**
- 🔴 **30% of medical prescriptions in Senegal are counterfeit**
- 💊 **42% of drugs in Sub-Saharan Africa are substandard or fake** (WHO, 2024)
- 💀 **122,000 deaths annually** due to counterfeit medications in Africa

**2. Medical Data Chaos**
- 📄 **80% of Senegalese citizens have NO digital medical records**
- 🔥 **Paper records lost, burned, or destroyed** in 65% of rural clinics
- ⏰ **Average time to retrieve medical history: 3-7 days** (if found at all)

**3. The Cost of Inefficiency**
- 💰 **$2.3 billion lost annually** to healthcare fraud in West Africa
- 🏥 **250,000 preventable deaths** from medical errors due to missing data
- 🔄 **40% of patients repeat tests** because previous results are inaccessible

---

### **Why This Problem is Currently Unsolvable:**

❌ **Traditional Systems Fail:**
- Centralized databases → Single points of failure
- Paper records → No traceability, easy to falsify
- Siloed hospital systems → Zero interoperability
- No verification mechanism → Pharmacies can't verify prescriptions

---

### **The Human Impact:**

> *"A mother loses her child because the emergency doctor couldn't access the allergy record from another hospital 20km away."*

**This is preventable. This is solvable. This is why we built FADJMA.**

---

## SLIDE 3: The Solution (The Hook)

### 🚀 FADJMA: Blockchain-Powered Healthcare Revolution

#### **What We Do:**

✅ **Anchor COMPLETE medical data** on Hedera blockchain (not just hashes)
✅ **Generate unique prescription matricules** (PRX-20251004-A3F2) for anti-counterfeiting
✅ **Enable real-time verification** via HashScan.io
✅ **Provide end-to-end drug traceability** (Doctor → Pharmacy → Patient)
✅ **Support 12+ consultation types** with intelligent classification

---

### **🌟 WORLD-FIRST INNOVATION: Enriched Anchoring v2.0**

#### **Competitors (Traditional Blockchain Anchoring):**
```
{
  "recordId": "rec-123",
  "hash": "abc123def456",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T10:00:00Z"
}
```
**3 fields • ~80 bytes • Hash only**

---

#### **FADJMA Enriched Anchoring:**
```
{
  "recordId": "rec-123",
  "hash": "abc123def456",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T10:00:00Z",
  "type": "MEDICAL_RECORD",

  // 🌟 COMPLETE MEDICAL DATA 🌟
  "title": "Cardiology Consultation",
  "diagnosis": "Mild hypertension",
  "prescription": "Amlodipine 5mg, rest recommended",
  "consultationType": "CARDIOLOGY",
  "medicalData": {
    "symptoms": ["chest pain", "fatigue"],
    "treatments": ["Amlodipine 5mg"],
    "vitalSigns": {"bloodPressure": "140/90", "heartRate": "85"}
  },

  "patientId": "patient-456",
  "doctorId": "doctor-789",
  "version": "2.0"
}
```
**15+ fields • ~400 bytes • 400% MORE DATA**

---

### **Result:**
📊 **Zero information loss**
🔒 **Complete medical history preserved**
⚡ **Instant verification**
🌍 **Accessible anywhere, anytime**

---

### **How Decentralization Provides Fundamental Advantage:**

1. **Trustless Verification:** No need to trust any single party
2. **Immutability:** Medical records cannot be altered or deleted
3. **Transparency:** Every action is auditable on public ledger
4. **Interoperability:** Universal access across all healthcare providers
5. **Patient Ownership:** Patients control their own data

---

## SLIDE 4: Why Hedera? ⚡ (MANDATORY)

### **Beyond Speed and Cost: Strategic Necessity**

#### **1. ABFT Consensus (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**

**What it means:**
- ✅ **Finality in 3-5 seconds** with mathematical certainty
- ✅ **No forks, no reversals** - Medical records are FINAL
- ✅ **Highest security guarantee** in DLT (proven mathematically)

**Why it matters for healthcare:**
> *"When a doctor prescribes life-saving medication, we CANNOT afford 'probable' consensus. We need ABSOLUTE finality. A patient's life depends on it."*

❌ **Ethereum:** Probabilistic finality (need to wait 6+ confirmations)
❌ **Traditional blockchains:** Fork risk = data integrity risk
✅ **Hedera:** Instant, guaranteed finality = Safe for medical use

---

#### **2. Predictable, Low Fees = Financial Sustainability**

### **Data Flow: Doctor Creates Medical Record**

**Step-by-Step Process:**

```
1. DOCTOR CREATES RECORD (Frontend)
   │
   ├─→ User Input: Title, Diagnosis, Prescription, Type
   │
   ▼
2. API REQUEST (HTTPS)
   │
   ├─→ POST /api/medical-records
   ├─→ JWT Token Validation
   ├─→ RBAC Check (is user a doctor?)
   │
   ▼
3. BACKEND PROCESSING
   │
   ├─→ A. Store in Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
   │   └─→ Returns: Record ID, Timestamp
   │
   ├─→ B. Generate Hash (SHA-256)
   │   └─→ Hash of: RecordID + PatientID + Diagnosis + Timestamp
   │
   ├─→ C. Prepare Hedera Message (Enriched Anchoring v2.0)
   │   └─→ JSON Payload with 15+ fields (see Slide 3)
   │
   ▼
4. HEDERA ANCHORING (Async)
   │
   ├─→ Submit to HCS Topic (0.0.6854064)
   │   └─→ TopicMessageSubmitTransaction
   │
   ├─→ Wait for Consensus (3-5 seconds)
   │
   ├─→ Retry Logic (if failure)
   │   └─→ Max 3 attempts, then add to queue
   │
   ▼
5. HEDERA CONFIRMATION
   │
   ├─→ Receive: Transaction Hash
   ├─→ Receive: Consensus Timestamp
   ├─→ Receive: Sequence Number
   │
   ▼
6. UPDATE DATABASE
   │
   ├─→ Store: hederaTxHash, consensusTimestamp
   ├─→ Mark: hederaAnchored = true
   │
   ▼
7. MIRROR NODE VERIFICATION (Optional)
   │
   ├─→ Query Mirror Node API
   ├─→ Verify: Transaction exists on public ledger
   ├─→ Store: Verification status
   │
   ▼
8. RESPONSE TO FRONTEND
   │
   ├─→ 200 OK
   ├─→ Return: Record + Hedera Hash + HashScan Link
   │
   ▼
9. DOCTOR SEES CONFIRMATION
   │
   └─→ UI: "✅ Anchored on Hedera" badge
       └─→ Link: "View on HashScan" button
```

### **Key Technical Components**

#### **1. Authentication & Authorization**

**JWT Token Structure:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "role": "DOCTOR",
  "email": "doctor@fadjma.sn",
  "exp": 1730000000,
  "iat": 1729913600
}
```

**RBAC Matrix:**

| Action | Patient | Doctor | Pharmacy | Admin | Assistant | Radiologist |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Create Record | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Own Record | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Patient Record | ❌ | ✅* | ❌ | ✅ | ✅* | ✅* |
| Create Prescription | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Verify Prescription | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage Appointments | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

*Requires explicit patient permission

---

#### **2. Hedera Integration Layer**

**Core Functions:**

**File:** `backend/src/services/hederaService.js`

```javascript
// Simplified pseudo-code
async function anchorToHedera(medicalRecord) {
  // 1. Prepare enriched message
  const message = {
    recordId: medicalRecord.id,
    hash: generateHash(medicalRecord),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    type: 'MEDICAL_RECORD',
    title: medicalRecord.title,
    diagnosis: medicalRecord.diagnosis,
    prescription: medicalRecord.prescription,
    consultationType: medicalRecord.consultationType,
    medicalData: medicalRecord.medicalData,
    patientId: medicalRecord.patientId,
    doctorId: medicalRecord.doctorId,
    version: '2.0'
  };

  // 2. Submit to HCS
  const transaction = new TopicMessageSubmitTransaction()
    .setTopicId(HEDERA_TOPIC_ID)
    .setMessage(JSON.stringify(message));

  // 3. Execute with retry logic
  return await executeWithRetry(transaction, 3);
}
```

**Retry Logic:**
```javascript
async function executeWithRetry(transaction, maxAttempts) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      const receipt = await transaction.execute(client);
      return receipt; // Success
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxAttempts) {
        // Add to queue for later retry
        await addToRetryQueue(transaction);
        throw error;
      }
      // Exponential backoff
      await sleep(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000);
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### **3. Prescription Matricule System**

**Format:** `PRX-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`

**Example:** `PRX-20251004-A3F2`

**Generation Algorithm:**
```javascript
function generateMatricule(prescription) {
  const date = formatDate(new Date(), 'YYYYMMDD'); // 20251004
  const uniqueId = generateShortHash(
    prescription.id +
    prescription.patientId +
    prescription.doctorId +
    Date.now()
  ).substring(0, 4).toUpperCase(); // A3F2

  return `PRX-${date}-${uniqueId}`;
}
```

**Anchoring:**
- Each matricule is individually anchored to Hedera
- Pharmacy searches by matricule → Verifies on blockchain
- Prevents double-dispensing and counterfeits

---

#### **4. Security Architecture**

**Layers of Security:**

1. **Transport:** HTTPS/TLS 1.3
2. **Authentication:** JWT with 24-hour expiration
3. **Authorization:** RBAC + row-level security
4. **Data at Rest:** AES-256 encryption (database)
5. **Data in Transit:** End-to-end encryption
6. **Audit Logging:** Winston logger (all actions logged)
7. **Blockchain Immutability:** Hedera HCS

**RGPD Compliance:**
- Patient data stored locally (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Only anonymized metadata + medical data sent to Hedera
- Patient consent required for data sharing
- Right to access: Download all records
- Right to erasure: Mark as deleted (blockchain record remains as proof, but data redacted)

---
